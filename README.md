# DoH-capable-DNS-forwarder

This project will require using Python to build a simple DNS forwarder with domain blocking and DoH capabilities. This DNS forwarder will need to do the following: (1) receive an arbitrary DNS message from a client, (2) check if the domain name should be blocked, and if so respond with an NXDomain message, (3) if the queried domain name is allowed, forward the DNS message to either standard DNS resolver or a DoH-capable resolver, (4) wait for the response from the resolver and forward it back to the client.

=== Details ===

Schema:

Client <==> DNS forwarder <==> DNS resolver < = = = > (DNS NSes)
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Command line parameters:

$ ./dns_forwarder.py -h
usage: dns_forwarder.py [-h] [-d DST_IP] -f DENY_LIST_FILE 
                        [-l LOG_FILE] [--doh] [--doh_server DOH_SERVER]

optional arguments:
-h, --help   show this help message and exit
-d   DST_IP Destination DNS server IP
-f   DENY_LIST_FILE File containing domains to block
-l   LOG_FILE Append-only log file
--doh   Use default upstream DoH server
--doh_server DOH_SERVER  Use this upstream DoH server

Requirements:

If --doh or --doh_server are specified, the forwarder MUST forward the DNS query using the DoH protocol
If neither --doh nor --doh_server are specified (in which case -d MUST be present), the forwarder MUST forward the DNS query using the DNS protocol
The DNS forwarder MUST receive DNS messages from the client via a simple UDP server socket.
When DoH is not used, the -d option will be specified and the forwarder must use a simple UDP client socket to forward the client's query to the DNS resolver
The DENY_LIST_FILE file MUST contain a (potentially empty) list of domain names that MUST be blocked by the forwarder. 
DoH REQUESTS
You are required to use GET requests as defined in RFC 8484. For instance, a DNS request for (qname='example.com', qtype='A') would look like:

https://8.8.8.8/dns-query?dns=AAABAAABAAAAAAAAB2V4YW1wbGUDY29tAAABAAE
Note: do not use the JSON API provided by some DNS operators.
You can find more information here:

https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/secure-transports#doh
https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encrypted-dns/dns-over-https/make-api-requests/dns-wireformat
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8484
NOTE: when working from the UGA campus network (including from your VM), use IP addresses (e.g., 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8, etc.) in the DoH query URL, because it appears that EITS is blocking some domain name strings related to DoH servers (e.g., dns.goole or cloudflare-dns.com).


DENY LIST FORMAT
The deny list provided in input will be a text file (not necessarily ending in .txt) containing one domain name per line. For instance:

www.example.com
cobweb.cs.uga.edu
yahoo.co.jp

only fully qualified domains should be blocked. For instance, in the above example only a domain matching yahoo.co.jp must be blocked (e.g., www.yahoo.co.jp should not be blocked).  

Note: when a domain is blocked, your DNS forwarder MUST reply to the client with a properly formatted NXDOMAIN response.

LOG FILE ENTRY FORMAT
The log file should be a text file containing a record of all domain names and query types that have been requested, and whether the request was blocked or allowed. For instance:

www.google.com A ALLOW
google.com NS ALLOW
www.yahoo.co.jp A ALLOW
yahoo.co.jp MX DENY
www.youtube.com A ALLOW
www.example.com A DENY
...


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Create a directory named with your last name. Put your program's files under that directory. Besides the code, the directory should also contain a file called StudentGroup.txt containing the name and email addresses of the students who collaborated on this project. Then, create a Project3-FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME.tar.gz archive containing that directory. For instance, in my case those would be:

_ perdisci
  |___ dns_forwarder.py

Project3-ROBERTO-PERDISCI.tar.gz

Finally, submit the .tar.gz file through eLC. Each student will have to submit their own project, even if they worked in a group. However, only one submission per group will actually be evaluated. Students in the same group MUST submit the same version of the code (i.e., identical tar.gz files).

Here is an example of how the code will be executed:

# ./dns_forwarder.py --doh_server 1.1.1.1 -l ./queries.log -f ./deny_list.txt

Assuming dns_fowarder.py is running on vmX.cs.uga.edu, you could use dig to test it. For instance (this is only an example):

$ dig @vmX.cs.uga.edu -t AAAA www.example.com

and you should see a response similar to this one (again, this is only an example):

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @vmX.cs.uga.edu -t AAAA www.example.com

; (1 server found)

If www.example.com needs to be blocked (i.e., it's in the deny list), then the DNS forwarder should generate a response that looks like this (note: this is only an example):



; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @vmX.cs.uga.edu -t AAAA www.example.com
